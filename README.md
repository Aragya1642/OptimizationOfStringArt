# Optimization Of String Art Tool
 
This repository contains code for one of my first projects in Python. The main code that needs to run is mygui.py and is dependent on the stringart.py file. When the gui opens, select the options given as well as a range for pins and lines. When selecting the number of pins and lines, it is a good idea to select a number above 100 for the minimum of pins and above 800 for minimmum of lines. This should give a decent outpit image.

**Variables needed to be entered**
* **Shape of canvas:** 'Circle' or 'Rectangle' 
* **Range of nails:** Number of dots can be connected
* **Weight:** The darkness of the string, the higher the darker
* **Range of Lines:** Number of strings on the canvas
* **Image:** The image you want to optimize in string art
